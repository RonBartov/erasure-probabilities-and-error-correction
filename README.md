# Erasure Probabilities and Error Correction
This project provides simulation analysis for examining theoretical concepts related to bit-channel erasure probabilities, encoding, channeling, decoding, and frame error rate (FER) analysis. 

The simulation implemented in a Python notenook using Google Colab.
The full analysis exists in the attached PDF file.
